                <p>The <span>Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act</span> requires the information on this
application. You do not have to give the information, but if you do not, we cannot
approve your child for free or reduced price meals. You must include the last four
digits of the social security number of the adult household member who signs the
application. The last four digits of the social security number is not required when
you apply on behalf of a foster child or you list a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program <mark>(SNAP)</mark>, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families <mark>(TANF)</mark> Program or Food
Distribution Program on Indian Reservations <mark>(FDPIR)</mark> case number or other FDPIR
identifier for your child or when you indicate that the adult household member signing
the application does not have a social security number. We will use your information
to determine if your child is eligible for free or reduced price meals, and for administration
and enforcement of the lunch and breakfast programs. We MAY share your
eligibility information with education, health, and nutrition programs to help them
evaluate, fund, or determine benefits for their programs, auditors for program reviews,
and law enforcement officials to help them look into violations of program rules.</p>
